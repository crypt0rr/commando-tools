## Usage

    Local system enumeration  :
        SharpWMI.exe action=query query="select * from win32_service" [namespace=BLAH]

    Remote system enumeration :
        SharpWMI.exe action=query computername=HOST1[,HOST2,...] query="select * from win32_service" [namespace=BLAH]

    Remote process creation   :
        SharpWMI.exe action=create computername=HOST[,HOST2,...] command="C:\temp\process.exe [args]"

    Remote VBS execution      :
        SharpWMI.exe action=executevbs computername=HOST[,HOST2,...] [eventname=blah]

    Note: Any remote function also takes an optional "username=DOMAIN\user" "password=Password123!"

    Examples:

        SharpWMI.exe action=query query="select * from win32_process"
        SharpWMI.exe action=query query="SELECT * FROM AntiVirusProduct" namespace="root\SecurityCenter2"
        SharpWMI.exe action=query computername=primary.testlab.local query="select * from win32_service"
        SharpWMI.exe action=query computername=primary,secondary query="select * from win32_process"
        SharpWMI.exe action=create computername=primary.testlab.local command="powershell.exe -enc ZQBj..."
        SharpWMI.exe action=executevbs computername=primary.testlab.local
        SharpWMI.exe action=executevbs computername=primary.testlab.local username="TESTLAB\harmj0y" password="Password123!"
