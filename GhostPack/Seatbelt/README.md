# Seatbelt

----

Seatbelt is a C# project that performs a number of security oriented host-survey "safety checks" relevant from both offensive and defensive security perspectives.

**SeatBelt.exe all** will run ALL enumeration checks, can be combined with **full**.

**SeatBelt.exe [CheckName] full** will prevent any filtering and will return complete results.

**SeatBelt.exe [CheckName] [CheckName2] ...** will run one or more specified checks only (case-sensitive naming!)

## Compile Instructions

We are not planning on releasing binaries for Seatbelt, so you will have to compile yourself :)

Seatbelt has been built against .NET 3.5 and is compatible with [Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532606&clcid=0x409). Simply open up the project .sln, choose "release", and build.
