This tool is intended for penetration testers who want to perform an engagement 
quickly and efficiently. While this tool can be used for more covert operations 
(including some additions below), it really shines when used at the scale of a 
large network.

At the core of it, you provide it a list of credentials you have dumped (or hashes, 
it can pass-the-hash) and a list of systems on the domain (I suggest scanning for 
port 445 first, or you can use "--scan"). It will tell you if the credentials you 
dumped are valid on the domain, and if you have local administrator access to a host. 
See below for additional features, like user hunting and host detail enumeration.

It is intended to be run on Kali Linux

                    v2.3 (Built 1/26/2018) - Chris King (@raikiasec)

                         For help: ./CredNinja.py -h

usage: CredNinja.py -a accounts_to_test.txt -s systems_to_test.txt
                    [-t THREADS] [--ntlm] [--valid] [--invalid] [-o OUTPUT]
                    [-p PASSDELIMITER] [--delay SECONDS %JITTER]
                    [--timeout TIMEOUT] [--stripe] [--scan]
                    [--scan-timeout SCAN_TIMEOUT] [-h] [--no-color] [--os]
                    [--domain] [--users] [--users-time USERS_TIME]

Quickly check the validity of multiple user credentials across multiple
servers and be notified if that user has local administrator rights on each
server.

Required Arguments:
  -a accounts_to_test.txt, --accounts accounts_to_test.txt
                        A word or file of user credentials to test. Usernames
                        are accepted in the form of "DOMAIN\USERNAME:PASSWORD"
  -s systems_to_test.txt, --servers systems_to_test.txt
                        A word or file of servers to test against. This can
			be a single system, a filename containing a list of
			systems, a gnmap file, or IP addresses in cidr notation.
			Each credential will be tested against each of these
                        servers by attempting to browse C$ via SMB

Optional Arguments:
  -t THREADS, --threads THREADS
                        Number of threads to use. Defaults to 10
  --ntlm                Treat the passwords as NTLM hashes and attempt to
                        pass-the-hash!
  --valid               Only print valid/local admin credentials
  --invalid             Only print invalid credentials
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Print results to a file
  -p PASSDELIMITER, --passdelimiter PASSDELIMITER
                        Change the delimiter between the account username and
                        password. Defaults to ":"
  --delay SECONDS %JITTER
                        Delay each request per thread by specified seconds
                        with jitter (example: --delay 20 10, 20 second delay
                        with 10% jitter)
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Amount of seconds wait for data before timing out.
                        Default is 15 seconds
  --stripe              Only test one credential on one host to avoid spamming
                        a single system with multiple login attempts (used to
                        check validity of credentials). This will randomly
                        select hosts from the provided host file.
  --scan                Perform a quick check to see port 445 is available on
                        the host before queueing it up to be processed
  --scan-timeout SCAN_TIMEOUT
                        Sets the timeout for the scan specified by --scan
                        argument. Default of 2 seconds
  -h, --help            Get help about this script's usage
  --no-color            Turns off output color. Written file is always
                        colorless

Additional Information Retrieval:
  --os                  Display the OS of the system if available (no extra
                        request is being sent)
  --domain              Display the primary domain of the system if available
                        (no extra request is being sent)
  --users               List the users that have logged in to the system in
                        the last 6 months (requires LOCAL ADMIN). Returns
                        usernames with the number of days since their home
                        directory was changed. This sends one extra request to
                        each host
  --users-time USERS_TIME
                        Modifies --users to search for users that have logged
                        in within the last supplied amount of days (default
                        100 days)










Changelog:

   v2.3 - Updated with some additional features
        
	* Added gnmap file parsing.  The file provided to the --systems (-s) argument
	  can now be a gnmap file (ending in .gnmap)
	* Added cidr notation parsing. The IP address provided to the --systems (-s)
	  argument can now be in cidr notation and it will properly expand the range
	  and test all systems within the ip space (make sure you provide --scan to 
	  scan the systems ahead of time!)
	* Made --scan multithreaded so it runs MUCH faster

   v2.0 - Initial release of CredNinja from the predecessor CredSwissArmy:

	* Same ability as the previous CredSwissArmy (using credentials and host list
	  to search for Local Admin access across a network via SMB)
        * Fully multithreaded!  It is 8x the speed of the old CredSwissArmy!
        * Handles errors and complex passwords much better
        * Can still pass-the-hash with the "--ntlm" option
        * Still has the same arguments as before
        * Added "--timeout", which allows scans to get done faster if you wish
        * Added "--scan", which runs a quick port 445 scan of the hosts to make sure 
	  they are connectable before trying creds on them
        * Added "--stripe", which tests each credential once across a random system 
	  (used to validate credentials without appearing suspicious in one systems' 
	  event log)
        * Added "--delay", which allows you to specify a delay between scanning hosts 
	  to be more covert.  "--delay 10 20" will delay for 10 seconds with a 20% 
	  jitter (so between 8-10 seconds)
        * Added color output so its more obvious when you get success!

	AND NOW THE COOL ADDITIONS

        * Added "--os", which shows the operating system of each system that it can 
	  fingerprint (no additional packet is sent to target host)
        * Added "--domain", which shows the primary domain the system is a member of 
	  (no additional packet is sent to the target host)
        * Added "--users", which shows a list of users' whose home directories have 
	  been modified in X amount of days (X is modifiable by "--users-days", default 
	  of 100). Basically an SMB User-Hunter that shows where users are logged in to 
	  or have been logged in to  (1 additional packet is sent to each target host)
        * Coming soon: Anti-virus detector to give notice to potential antivirus running 
	  on the system
