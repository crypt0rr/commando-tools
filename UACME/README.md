# UACMe
* Defeating Windows User Account Control by abusing built-in Windows AutoElevate backdoor.

# System Requirements

* x86-32/x64 Windows 7/8/8.1/10 (client, some methods however works on server version too).
* Admin account with UAC set on default settings required.

# Usage

Run executable from command line: akagi32 [Key] [Param] or akagi64 [Key] [Param]. See "Run examples" below for more info.

First param is number of method to use, second is optional command (executable file name including full path) to run. Second param can be empty - in this case program will execute elevated cmd.exe from system32 folder.

Keys (watch debug output with dbgview or similar for more info):

Note:
* Method (6) unavailable in wow64 environment starting from Windows 8;
* Method (11) (54) implemented only in x86-32 version;
* Method (13) (19) (30) (50) implemented only in x64 version;
* Method (14) require process injection, wow64 unsupported, use x64 version of this tool;
* Method (26) is still working, however it main advantage was UAC bypass on AlwaysNotify level. Since 15031 it is gone;
* Method (30) require x64 because it abuses WOW64 subsystem feature;
* Method (35) AlwaysNotify compatible as there always will be running autoelevated apps or user will have to launch them anyway;
* Method (55) is not really reliable (as any GUI hacks) and included just for fun.

Run examples:
* akagi32.exe 1
* akagi64.exe 3
* akagi32 1 c:\windows\system32\calc.exe
* akagi64 3 c:\windows\system32\charmap.exe

# Warning
* This tool shows ONLY popular UAC bypass method used by malware, and reimplement some of them in a different way improving original concepts. There are different, not yet known to the general public, methods. Be aware of this;  
* Using (5) method will permanently turn off UAC (after reboot), make sure to do this in test environment or don't forget to re-enable UAC after tool usage;
* Using (5), (9) methods will permanently compromise security of target keys (UAC Settings key for (5) and IFEO for (9)). If you do tests on your real machine - restore keys security manually after you complete this tool usage;
* This tool is not intended for AV tests and not tested to work in aggressive AV environment, if you still plan to use it with installed bloatware AV soft - use it at your own risk;
* Some AV may flag this tool as HackTool, MSE/WinDefender constantly marks it as malware, nope;
* If you run this program on real computer remember to remove all program leftovers after usage, for more info about files it drops to system folders see source code;
* Most of methods created for x64, with no x86-32 support in mind. I don't see any sense in supporting 32 bit versions of Windows or wow64, however with small tweaks most of them will run under wow64 as well.

If you wondering why this still exists and working - here is the explanation - an official Microsoft WHITEFLAG (including totally incompetent statements as bonus)

# Windows 10 support and testing policy
* EOL'ed versions of Windows 10 are not supported and therefore not tested (at moment of writing EOL'ed Windows 10 versions are: TH1 (10240), TH2 (10586)), RS2 (15063), RS3 (16299);
* Insider builds are not supported as methods may be fixed there.

# Protection
* Account without administrative privileges.

# Malware usage
* It is currently known that UACMe used by Adware/Multiplug (9), by Win32/Dyre (3), by Win32/Empercrypt (10 & 13), by IcedID downloader (35 & 41). We do  not take any responsibility for this tool usage in the malicious purposes. It is free, open-source and provided AS-IS for everyone.

# Other usage
* Currently used as "signature" by "THOR APT" scanner (handmade pattern matching fraudware from Germany). We do  not take any responsibility for this tool usage in the fraudware;
* The scamware project called "uacguard" has references to UACMe from their platform. We do not take any responsibility for this tool usage in the scamware. The repository https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME and it contents are the only genuine source for UACMe code. We have nothing to do with external links to this project, mentions anywhere as well as modifications (forks);
* In July 2016 so-called "security company" Cymmetria released report about script-kiddie malware bundle called "Patchwork" and false flagged it as APT. They stated it was using "UACME method", which in fact is just slightly and unprofessionally modified injector dll from UACMe v1.9 and was using Carberp/Pitou hybrid method in malware self-implemented way. We do not take any responsibility for UACMe usage in the dubious advertising campaigns from third party "security companies".

# Build 

* UACMe comes with full source code, written in C with some parts written in C#;
* In order to build from source you need Microsoft Visual Studio 2013/2015 U2 and later versions.

# Compiled Binaries

* They are not provided since 2.8.9 and will never be provided in future. Coupe of reasons why not and why you should not provide them too to the general public:
   * If you look at this project in a nutshell it is a HackTool, despite initial goal to be a demonstrator. Of course several AV's detects it as HackTool (MS WD for example), however most of VirusTotal patients detects it as generic "malware". Which is of course incorrect, however unfortunately some lazy malware writters blindly copy-paste code to their crapware (or even simple use this tool directly) thus some AV created signatures based on project code parts;
   * By giving compiled binaries to everyone you make life of script-kiddies much easier because having need to compile from source works as perfect barrier for exceptionaliy dumb script-kiddies and "button-clickers";
   * Having compiled binaries in the repository will ultimately lead to flagging this repository pages as malicious (due to above reasons) by various content filters (SmartScreen, Google Safe Browsing etc).
* This decision is a final and won't be changed.

## Instructions

* Select Platform ToolSet first for project in solution you want to build (Project->Properties->General): 
  * v120 for Visual Studio 2013;
  * v140 for Visual Studio 2015; 
  * v141 for Visual Studio 2017;
  * v142 for Visual Studio 2019.
* For v140 and above set Target Platform Version (Project->Properties->General):
  * If v140 then select 8.1 (Note that Windows 8.1 SDK must be installed);
  * If v141/v142 then select 10 (Note that Windows 10 SDK must be installed). 
  
* Note that Fujinami module built with .NET Framework 3.0 (this is requirement for it work), so .NET Framework 3.0 must be installed if you want to build this module.
* Can be built with SDK 8.1/10.17134/10.17763/10.18362.
