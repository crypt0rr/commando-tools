'''

A brief description of the server module can be placed up here
All import should go between the comments and class declaration
If you have a question, feel free to check out the other server
modules ot just hit me up.

Finally, be sure to rename this to a .py file

'''

class Server:

    def __init__(self, cli_object):
        # self.protocol is the protocol that is viewable when using --list-servers
        # This is what the user would use along with --server.  It is the only
        # required attribute of the object.
        # You have complete access to command line arguments
        # within __init__
        # Anything that needs to be set for the server to run should have
        # a self attribute created within __init__
        self.protocol = ""

    # This is the main function that is called by the framework
    # You can build out as many different functions, but they all
    # need to be called from "serve".  If there is a specific function
    # or class that must be seperated out from this file (ideally keep
    # everything in here if possible), then add them to the serverlibs
    # directory
    def serve(self):
        
        return
