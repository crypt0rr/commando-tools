This is the template that should be used for client modules.
A brief description of the client module can/should be placed
up here.  All necessary imports should be placed between the
comments and class declaration.

Finally, be sure to rename your client module to a .py file

'''


class Client:

    # Within __init__, you have access to everything passed in
    # via the command line.  self.protocol is the variable listed
    # when running --list-clients and is what is used in conjunction
    # with --client <client>.  self.protocol is the only required attribute
    # of the object.
    def __init__(self, cli_object):
        self.protocol = ""

    # transmit is the only required function within the object.  It is what
    # called by the framework to transmit data.  However, you can create as 
    # many "sub functions" for transmit to invoke as needed.  "data_to_transmit"
    # is a variable passed in by the framework which contains the data that 
    # is to be sent out by the client.
    def transmit(self, data_to_transmit):
        
        return
