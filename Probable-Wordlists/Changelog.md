* Made subtle changes to all files to prepare for a BFG (https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) purge. I set it up so that if files were not from the last commit, they would not remain.

#### 17 June 2017
* I added a bunch of Shout-Outs, since there was a huge spike in popularity after I posted this on hackernews. There were probably a dozen or so edits since the last edit to the changelog
* All edits since 15 May 2017 have been to README.md, except for the inclusion of...
* Trend Analysis was added __23 May 2017__
* Torrents had a problem on June 11 after the popularity spike. “I guess that’s what you call one of them good problems.”
* Added “Include Count List” to Rev 2 Tasklist.
* Cleaned up README.md a bit

#### 20 Jun 2017

#### 9 Feb 2018
* Deleted "Torrent Note" at beginning of ReadMe

* Added Torrents and MegaLinks
* Updated README's
* Added Analysis-Files Section
* Realized that in compressed versions, `Top1575-probable-v2.txt` is named `Top1575-probable2.txt` - not worth taking down and re-uploading the torrents and links for this.
