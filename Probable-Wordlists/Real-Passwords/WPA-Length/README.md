# Real-WPA-Length-Passwords


##  These Are The WPA-Length Passwords!

  * The lines in this folder are all 8-40 characters long. This is the format used by routers protected by WPA/2 security
  * Their length is in their title.
  * These files were generated by removing entries from the Real-Passwords files that did not fit the length requirements.

<br>
Lists sorted by popularity will include `probable-v2` in the filename.

__Note that these files are CUMULATIVE.__ <br>

I.E, the entirety of the smallest file is contained in the 2nd smallest file. All of the smaller files are contained in the largest file.  <br>

However, each unique line appears only once in each file.


### Torrents
* Contained within are torrents of the Real-Password-WPA Files
* Two styles of compression are available: 7Z, and tar.gz
* After downloading, __remember to seed__ to help others get the same access you did.
* Mega.nz Links are also provided  as a more predictable alternative to torrents

#### Recommended Unarchivers:
* Windows: __7Zip__
* Mac: __Keka__
* Linux: Command Line, __p7zip__

#### Recommended Torrent Client:
* __Deluge__ gave me the best results in terms of connecting to the seedbox.
