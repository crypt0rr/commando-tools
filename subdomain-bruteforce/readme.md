subdomain bruteforce for windows is best used in conjunction with other tools - combining their results and dupekilling them.
it uses async get requests to brute force subdomains and is pretty fast and accurate over p80/443.

**roadmap, misc. notes**<br/>
i may add multi-host support, [recursion](https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion), web spidering, directory and
file enumeration in the future. as well as making it more traditionally user friendly.  re: file/directory scanning- 
dirbuster for linux is handy (and wonderful) but it only targets one host at a time and doesn't discover subdomains.
[ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) looks incredible as well. that's written in go and seems fast and feature rich.
the future of this *prog* may involve the addition of [several features](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/b202a2/subdomain_bruteforce_for_windows/eiqda66/?context=10000), a name change and focus on [point and click simplicity](https://youtu.be/hkDD03yeLnU?t=7). without heavy feature additions this tool is nowhere in the same class as the others i've mentioned.
